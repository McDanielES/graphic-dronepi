#### Abstract:
Federal and state environmental agencies delegate industries the responsibility to maintain a permissible level of pollution in the environment. Multicopter drones offer scientists and engineers a flexible and creative solution to collect and analyze atmospheric pollution data. Drones are a popular, cost-efficient tool that can be customized for data collection in several fields of study. Utilizing such drones can offer cities, manufacturing plants, and regulatory bodies a solution to monitor environmental compliance and affordably measure the concentration of selected gases within a predefined geospatial area. Modular construction of interchangeable components provides the flexibility to customize sensor packages based on what pollutant is to be targeted for detection. The design and construction of a custom-built drone is described here, where a headless Raspberry Pi 3B+ single-board computer and various gas and GPS sensors are mounted on to a human-controlled hexacopter drone. Software is designed to automate the collection of readings, allowing the pilot to only concentrate on the flight of the drone. The SSH network protocol allows the Raspberry Pi to be controlled remotely from the ground if desired. LED bulbs mounted on the airframe additionally provide instant feedback of the drone's status. Results recorded from tests are collected post-flight and are plotted graphically for analysis.
